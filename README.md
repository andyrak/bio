# Glitch in Bio!

Your links, your way. A link-in-bio app you can customize any way you want.

IMPORTANT: That is a theme remix of [Glitch in bio](https://glitch.com/~glitch-in-bio) (Original project). I recommend taking a look at it first.

### Edit `settings.json` to add your own info and links

Replace the meta info, links and social sites we added for you in `settings.json` and you'll see your changes instantly updated in real time! 

Activate or deactivate splash loading image in `settings -> splash (true/false)`

For the links icons, you will search icon name in [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/)

### Modify theme

To help you make the site your own we've included some themes. In `settings.json` you can enter `simple` (default) or `custom-theme` as the value for `theme`. 

üìù  _If you want to see how these themes are made, look in the `public/styles/themes` directory! If you don't have a valid theme entered, the site will default to the styles outlined in `style.css`._

### ...or create your own!

Customize your site by updating `custom-theme.css` inside the `public/styles/themes` folder with CSS to update colors, fonts, or any other style rules. Update your `theme` in `settings.json` to `custom-theme` to have the app use those new rules.
